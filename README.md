# leagr_patch
League management solution written in Django, targeting circa 2009 GCP App Engine.  Very early stage code.

No guarantees this can still be made to run as it was targeting a very early release of Google App Engine, and hasn't been re-tested in 10 years.

In the days when this was written Django was not well supported in App Engine, so an additional framework was used to make it work (App Engine Patch)
